This is a chat application on the local network. No configuration
needed, just type 

~node client.js~

and start typing. Anyone else that also does 
~node client.js~ 

will be able to talk as well.

This works by sending multicasting messages over UDP.

* Etc Written in OCaml, compiled to JS. 
To actually compile this project you'll need my ~ocaml-nodejs~
bindings.
